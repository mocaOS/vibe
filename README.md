# Introducing Vibe Studio

This community-driven genAI app store is brought you by the Museum of Crypto Art. The vibe studio represents a revolutionary approach to digital creativity and content creation. This open source codebase plugs into [mocaOS](https://github.com/mocaOS/museum) allowing developers to leverage a vast array of CC0 datapoints around ArtDecc0s (media, codex, etc) to generate content like [videos](https://x.com/reneil1337/status/1973418462145028153) and other derivatives that fuel storytelling in highly accessible fashion. 

By abstracting complex AI workflows into simple user interfaces the MOCA allows communities to get creative. The vibe studio invites devs and vibecoders alike to team up with n8n or comfyUI builders to ship apps that resolve around the narratives and memetics that are shaping the web3 space at a given point in time. 



#### MOCA Library

The [MOCA Library](https://v2.museumofcryptoart.com/) an ever growing knowledge graph curated by the museum can be accessed by vibe studio devs to enrich their apps with agentic knowledge around web3 arts and culture. The ability to plug that kind of fine-tuned intelligence seamlessly into vibe studio apps is gonna result in interesting experiences whereas lots of heavy lifting is being taken care of by MOCA. 

 

## Leveraging $moca and $com

Our partner [comput3](https://x.com/comput3ai) is providing a broad range of AI tooling that exist on their infrastructure. Their API keys which can be obtained via [subscription or staking](https://console.comput3.ai/) grant access to SOTA language models as well as a range of different customizable comfyUI setups. From imageGen over videoGen to 3D asset generation a lot of different pipelines are provided as ready-to-use templates that can be used to be adjusted via comfyUI workflows.  For launch there are 2 types of apps that users can launch in vibe studio:

- Powered by MOCA
  - Free to use for Art Decc0 holders + $moca stakers
  - These apps utilize comput3 api keys by the museum
- Bring your own key
  - Paste in your own comput3 api key to start the app



## The ArtDecc0 ecosystem

A lot of the early apps are going to resolve around Art Decc0s and will be free to our holders. The goal is to provide a scalable range of utility that can be explored and accessed from the vibe studio.



#### Art Decc0s Codex

At the heart of Vibe Studio's creative potential lies the Art Decc0s Codex, a large pool of unique personality data that MOCA provided for each of the 10k ArtDecc0s in 2025. These structured data points are not only used to generate [elizaOS character files](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/) but are also served from the [mocaOS apis](https://github.com/mocaOS/museum) for vibe studio app devs to enrich their apps which should result in simpler UX for Art Decc0 related apps. 

 

## Vibe Studio Apps

Vibe Studio features a growing collection of apps that showcase the power of the MOCA ecosystem:

### Codex
Dive into the universe of 10,000 unique Art Decc0 characters, each with their own personality, story, and visual identity. Explore detailed profiles, filter by traits, and discover your favorite digital beings.

### Adoption Center
Find and adopt your perfect Art Decc0 companion. Browse through available Decc0s, learn about their unique characteristics, chat with them to understand their personality, and bring them home.

### MOCA Museum
Access the Museum of Crypto Art's official collections and AI-powered library. Explore curated collections from the Genesis Collection to the Matt Kane Collection, and dive into a vast knowledge base of crypto art history.

### Rooms Archive
Experience the evolution of digital art curation through time. Like a Wayback Machine for crypto art, explore MOCA's virtual gallery spaces and see how they've changed and developed over time.

### MOCA Substack
Dig into years of crypto art and web3 related writing. Access the Museum's comprehensive publication archive, a living chronicle of the digital art movement with insights from artists, cultural analysis, and technical explorations.

 

## Building Open Source Infra

While we are building the vibe studio for our own ecosystem we invite other web3 communities to fork the codebase and curate their own apps which integrate assets and related data from their own respective backends. By integrating the comput3 infrastructure layer seamlessly into the vibe studio we enable other teams to fuel their forked app store with intelligence in a simple and effective manner. 



## Running Vibe Studio Locally

To run Vibe Studio on your local machine:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 12 or higher)
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8082

The server will start on port 8080. If you need to change the port, you can modify the `PORT` variable in `server.js`.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

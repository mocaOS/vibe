# The Vibe Studio

**MOCA's City Center for Crypto Art, AI Agents, and Creative Innovation**

The Vibe Studio is the nexus for everything the Museum of Crypto Art has created, is creating, and will create in the future. It's MOCA's cumulative UI/UX overhaul—a navigable network of applications, tools, and experiences that bring together the Museum's collections, the Art DeCC0s agentic ecosystem, and community-built innovations into one unified home.

This open-source codebase serves as both MOCA's digital headquarters and a framework for other web3 communities to build their own application ecosystems. By integrating seamlessly with [mocaOS](https://github.com/mocaOS/museum) and leveraging CC0 data around Art DeCC0s, the Vibe Studio enables developers to create compelling experiences that fuel storytelling and creativity in highly accessible ways.

## What's Inside

The Vibe Studio hosts a growing collection of applications spanning multiple categories:

Find your perfect digital companion. Chat 1-on-1 with a rotating cast of Art DeCC0s (initially those listed at floor price), discover their unique personalities, form genuine connections, and when you've found the right match, take your new best friend home. It's a testing ground for agentic conversation where you can explore the varied personalities within the Art DeCC0s collection.

**[DeCC0 Agent Launcher](http://v2.museumofcryptoart.com/decc0s)**
Your hub for fine-tuning DeCC0 agents into actionable entities. Built on ElizaOS, this is where you teach your DeCC0s, expand their datasets, make them experts in any areas you like, and eventually set them loose on tasks. If The Codex is each DeCC0's nature, the Agent Launcher is the place of nurture.

## The Technology Behind It

### The Art DeCC0s Codex

At the heart of Vibe Studio's creative potential lies the Art DeCC0s Codex—a near-limitless environment of personality data created through the technical brilliance of DaïmAlYad. Using multimodal generation and peerless problem-solving, each of the 10,000 Art DeCC0s has been imbued with unique, interactive characteristics.

The Codex contains:
- Each DeCC0's name, biography, and favorite artist
- Their writing style, hometown, and self-conceptualization
- Appearances, predilections, and sensitivities
- Inherent knowledge bases and sample conversations
- Technical information for agentic launchers like ElizaOS

This massive dataset serves as both a way for DeCC0 holders to understand their NFTs' personalities and a framework for ambitious developers to create better, more complex, more alive agents.

### Integration with mocaOS

The Vibe Studio plugs directly into [mocaOS](https://github.com/mocaOS/museum), allowing developers to leverage:
- CC0 datapoints around Art DeCC0s (media, codex data, etc.)
- The MOCA Library—an ever-growing knowledge graph of web3 arts and culture
- AI-powered retrieval systems for agentic knowledge
- ElizaOS character files for agent creation

## Building for the Vibe Studio

The Vibe Studio is designed for expansion. We welcome developers, artists, and vibecoders to build applications that integrate with the MOCA ecosystem.

### For Developers

The Vibe Studio represents a revolutionary approach to community-driven application ecosystems. By abstracting complex AI workflows into simple user interfaces, we enable communities to get creative. Whether you're working with n8n, ComfyUI, or custom solutions, the Vibe Studio provides a platform to ship apps that revolve around the narratives and memetics shaping the web3 space.

### Submit Your App

If you have something you're building or have built, and you want to include it in the Vibe Studio:
- Reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Rs7wxUTrWV)
- DM us on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/museumofcrypto)
- Open an issue or PR on this repository

100% of proceeds within community apps go to their creators. We provide the platform and userbase; you bring the innovation.

### Fork for Your Community

While we're building the Vibe Studio for our own ecosystem, we invite other web3 communities to fork this codebase and curate their own apps. Integrate assets and data from your own backends, leverage AI infrastructure partners, and create your own application ecosystem.
